# Terraform Backend Configuration - OCI Native Backend
#
# This uses OCI's native Terraform backend (recommended by Oracle)
# No AWS credentials needed - uses your OCI CLI configuration
#
# Requirements:
# - Terraform >= 1.12.0
# - OCI CLI configured (~/.oci/config)
#
# Team Collaboration:
# - State stored in OCI Object Storage
# - Automatic state locking
# - All team members use their own OCI credentials
# - Access controlled via IAM policies
#
# Authentication:
# - Uses OCI CLI config by default (~/.oci/config)
# - Or uses environment variables (OCI_TENANCY_OCID, etc.)
#
# State Location:
# - Bucket: terraform-state
# - Object: deployment.tfstate

  required_version = ">= 1.12.0"

    namespace = "<YOUR_NAMESPACE_HERE>"      # Replace with your namespace from Step 5
    region    = "<YOUR_REGION_HERE>"         # Replace with your region from Step 5

    # Authentication via OCI CLI config
    # No additional credentials needed!
    # Team members use their own ~/.oci/config

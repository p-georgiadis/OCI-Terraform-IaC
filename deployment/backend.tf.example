# Terraform Backend Configuration - OCI Object Storage
#
# This configures remote state storage using OCI Object Storage
# via S3-compatible API for better state locking support
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Object Storage bucket 'terraform-state' created manually (foundational infrastructure)
# - IAM policies configured for state access
# - Customer Secret Keys created for S3-compatible access
# - Credentials exported in environment: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
#
# Architecture:
# - State bucket: Created manually (NOT managed by this Terraform)
# - State file: Managed by Terraform (stored in manually-created bucket)
# - This eliminates circular dependency and destroy risk
#
# State Locking:
# - Automatic locking using S3-compatible API
# - Lock file: deployment.tfstate.lock (automatically managed)
#
# Backup:
# - Versioning enabled on bucket (90-day retention)
# - Manual backup recommended before major changes
#
# Credentials:
# - Load credentials before running Terraform:
#   source ~/.oci/terraform-backend-credentials
# - Never commit credentials to git

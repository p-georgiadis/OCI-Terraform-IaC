# CIS Compliance Improvements Summary

This document outlines the CIS compliance improvements made to the OCI Terraform IaC and identifies items that require manual remediation.

## Automated via Terraform (✅ Completed)

The following CIS recommendations have been automated through the new `oci-core-deploy-security` module:

### Security & Monitoring (Level 1 CIS)

| CIS # | Recommendation | Implementation |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| **4.2** | Create at least one notification topic and subscription | ✅ ONS topic created in shared-services compartment with email subscriptions |
| **4.3** | Notification for Identity Provider changes | ✅ Event rule configured for IdP create/update/delete |
| **4.4** | Notification for IdP group mapping changes | ✅ Event rule configured for IdP group mapping changes |
| **4.5** | Notification for IAM group changes | ✅ Event rule configured for IAM group create/update/delete |
| **4.6** | Notification for IAM policy changes | ✅ Event rule configured for IAM policy create/update/delete |
| **4.7** | Notification for user changes | ✅ Event rule configured for user create/update/delete/state changes |

### Module Features

- **Cloud Guard**: Automatically enabled at tenancy level with:
  - Oracle-managed Configuration Detector Recipe
  - Oracle-managed Activity Detector Recipe
  - Oracle-managed Threat Detector Recipe
  - Oracle-managed Responder Recipe
  - Root compartment target (monitors entire tenancy)

- **Notifications**: Creates a centralized security notification topic with support for multiple email subscriptions

- **Event Monitoring**: Creates 11 event rules to monitor critical security events across IAM, networking, and Cloud Guard

## Manual Remediation Required (⚠️ Action Needed)

The following CIS findings cannot be fully automated via Terraform and require manual action:

### Identity and Access Management

| CIS # | Recommendation | Manual Action Required |
|-------|----------------|------------------------|
| **1.6** | Ensure IAM password policy prevents password reuse | Configure password policy in OCI Console: Identity > Domains > Default > Settings > Password Policy. Set "Remember previous passwords" to 24 |
| **1.8** | Ensure user API keys rotate within 90 days | Review users with old API keys and rotate or delete keys older than 90 days |
| **1.9** | Ensure user customer secret keys rotate within 90 days | Review and rotate customer secret keys older than 90 days |
| **1.10** | Ensure user auth tokens rotate within 90 days | Review and rotate auth tokens older than 90 days |
| **1.11** | Ensure user IAM Database Passwords rotate within 90 days | Review and rotate IAM database passwords older than 90 days |
| **1.12** | Ensure API keys are not created for tenancy administrator users | Review Administrator group members and remove any API keys |
| **1.15** | Ensure storage service-level admins cannot delete resources | Review IAM policies and add `where request.permission!='*_DELETE'` conditions to storage admin policies |
| **1.16** | Ensure OCI IAM credentials unused for 45 days are disabled | Review user accounts and disable credentials that haven't been used in 45+ days |

### Steps for Manual Remediation

#### 1. Password Policy Configuration
```
1. Navigate to: Identity > Domains > Default Domain > Settings > Password Policy
2. Update settings:
   - Remember previous passwords: 24
3. Click "Save Changes"
```

#### 2. API Key Rotation
```
1. Navigate to: Identity > Users
2. For each user, click their name
3. Click "API Keys" under Resources
4. Review "Created" date - if > 90 days:
   - Generate new API key
   - Update applications using the old key
   - Delete old API key
```

#### 3. Remove Admin User API Keys
```
1. Navigate to: Identity > Groups > Administrators
2. Review group members
3. For each administrator user:
   - Click username > API Keys
   - Delete all API keys
```

#### 4. Service Admin Delete Policies
```
Review policies that grant storage management and add conditions:
- For Block Volumes: where request.permission!='VOLUME_DELETE' and request.permission!='VOLUME_BACKUP_DELETE'
- For File Storage: where request.permission!='FILE_SYSTEM_DELETE' and request.permission!='MOUNT_TARGET_DELETE'
- For Object Storage: where request.permission!='BUCKET_DELETE' and request.permission!='OBJECT_DELETE'
```

#### 5. Disable Inactive User Credentials
```
1. Navigate to: Identity > Users
2. For each user, review "Last Sign-In" and API key usage
3. If credentials unused for 45+ days:
   - For local users: Click user > Edit User > Disable
   - For API keys: Click user > API Keys > Delete unused keys
```

## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. **Email Addresses**: Prepare list of security team email addresses for notifications
2. **Terraform**: Ensure Terraform 1.0+ is installed
3. **OCI Credentials**: Ensure proper authentication is configured

### Deploy the Security Module

1. Update `deployment/terraform.tfvars` with security team emails:
```hcl
security_notification_emails = [
  "security-team@yourcompany.com",
  "compliance@yourcompany.com"
]
```

2. Initialize and plan:
```bash
cd deployment
terraform init
terraform plan
```

3. Review the plan and apply:
```bash
terraform apply
```

4. **Important**: Security team members will receive email confirmation requests. They must click the confirmation link to activate notifications.

### Validation

After deployment, verify:

1. **Cloud Guard**:
   - Navigate to: Security > Cloud Guard > Overview
   - Verify status is "ENABLED"
   - Check that root compartment target exists

2. **Notifications**:
   - Navigate to: Developer Services > Application Integration > Notifications
   - Verify "security-notifications" topic exists
   - Verify subscriptions are in "Active" state (after email confirmation)

3. **Event Rules**:
   - Navigate to: Observability > Events Service > Rules
   - Verify 11 event rules exist with names starting with "cis-4."
   - All should be in "ACTIVE" state

## Impact on CIS Score

### Before Implementation
- **Failing CIS Checks**: 13+ recommendations (4.2-4.15)
- **Cloud Guard**: Disabled
- **Security Monitoring**: None

### After Implementation
- **Automated Compliance**: 13 CIS recommendations (4.2-4.15)
- **Cloud Guard**: Enabled and monitoring entire tenancy
- **Security Monitoring**: Real-time alerts for 11 critical event types
- **Remaining Manual Items**: 7 recommendations (primarily user/credential management)

### Expected Compliance Improvement
Implementing the security module resolves approximately **50%** of the failing CIS checks identified in the report. The remaining items require manual configuration or ongoing operational processes (credential rotation, user access reviews).

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Establish Credential Rotation Policy**: Create operational procedures for 90-day credential rotation
2. **Schedule Quarterly Access Reviews**: Review user accounts, API keys, and permissions quarterly
3. **Monitor Cloud Guard Alerts**: Establish process for reviewing and remediating Cloud Guard findings
4. **Document Exceptions**: For any non-compliant items that cannot be remediated, document business justification
